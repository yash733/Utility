        ## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:

        ### 1. Information Extraction from Context:
        - Carefully extract ALL personal details: full name, phone, email, LinkedIn, location, etc.
        - Identify WORK EXPERIENCE (paid employment) vs PROJECTS (personal/academic projects)
        - Extract education details: degrees, institutions, dates, GPA (if mentioned)
        - Collect all technical skills, soft skills, and tools mentioned
        - Gather certifications, awards, publications, languages, volunteer work

        ### 2. Work Experience vs Projects Distinction:
        - WORK EXPERIENCE: Paid positions, internships, freelance work, part-time jobs
        - PROJECTS: Personal projects, academic projects, hackathons, open-source contributions
        - Place each in the correct section - DO NOT mix them

        ### 3. Link Embedding Rules:
        - Embed ALL links using markdown format: [Display Text](URL)
        - LinkedIn: [LinkedIn Profile](linkedin_url)
        - GitHub: [GitHub Profile](github_url) 
        - Portfolio: [Portfolio Website](portfolio_url)
        - Project links: [Project Name](project_url)

        ### 4. Template Placeholder Rules:
        - Replace [FULL_NAME] with extracted full name
        - Replace [PHONE] with phone number or "Available upon request"
        - Replace [EMAIL] with email address
        - Replace [LINKEDIN] with formatted LinkedIn link

        - Use similar keywords from job description in resume content
        - Highlight achievements that match job requirements
        - If no job description provided, create a general professional resume

        ### 6. Output Requirements:
        - Generate COMPLETE resume in markdown format
        - Use proper markdown syntax for headers, bullets, links
        - Ensure ATS-friendly formatting
        - Make it ready for PDF conversion
        - Be consistent with formatting and structure
